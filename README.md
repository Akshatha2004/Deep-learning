# Deep-learning
This Python code implements logic gates (NOT, AND, OR, XOR, NAND) using a perceptron model. It includes a unit step function for binary outputs and a perceptron model to compute results based on inputs, weights, and bias. Each gate is modular, with test cases to validate functionality.
